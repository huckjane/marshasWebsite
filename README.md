Marsha's Website
This project was begun as a portfolio of my experience and work. This is a clumsy work in progress. Most of my coding experience is in the backend and this venture to the front side has been at times exciting, at others frustrating, but most of all extremely rewarding.

HTML & CSS: This is the first website that I have designed in about 10 years. It's creation required complete relearning of HTML and CSS, for which I have both freeCodeCamp and David DuRocher's Quickstart Guide to thank.

JAVASCRIPT: During the design of this site, I have executed my first Vanilla Javascript code ever, with the creation of the particle text and constellation. Credit to Frank's Laboratory YouTube channel for the invaluable tutorials that made those possible.
